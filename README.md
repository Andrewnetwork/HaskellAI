# HaskellAI
A repo for some Haskell code used for particular AI applications. 

I use the [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/downloads#platform) as my development environment. 

## Using the scripts interactively
1. Start ghc in the console. 
```
ghc
```
2. Load scripts to work with.
```
:l script.hs
```
